# Uncommon HTML Error: Typo in getElementById

This repository demonstrates a subtle error that can occur in HTML when using JavaScript to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM).

The `bug.html` file contains a typo in the `getElementById` method, preventing the JavaScript code from correctly modifying the DOM. The correct solution is in `bugSolution.html`.

This example highlights the importance of careful coding and attention to detail, particularly when working with dynamic content and JavaScript.
